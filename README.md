### Hello! My name is Andrew Sobotka and I am a Software Developer.
---
ðŸ”­ Currently Open for WorkðŸ”­

You'll find me in the intersection of Technology and Art. I've always found the space that exists between what is aesthetically  beautiful and what is technologically mindblowing to be where I spend most of my time. That space has the most interesting problems to solve and the most enthusiastic people to solve those problems with.

With over a decade of *"Graphic Design"* Experience (Design, Layout, Photography, 3D Modeling, Lighting, Texturing, UI/UX Design...), I have moved over to a career in Software Development. Now I spend my time doing what I love to do more than anything... _learning_. There is a near-infinite amount of data, processess, patterns, and language to learn.

I am currently looking for my first position as a Full-Stack Developer, and I am open to working on collaborative projects, help with open-source projects, or just to chat about anything concerning A.I., Machine Learning, or Software Development.
